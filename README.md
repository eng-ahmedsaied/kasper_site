kasper_site
Kasper Site is a modern and responsive landing page built using only HTML and CSS.
The design is inspired by clean, minimalist layouts and showcases essential web layout techniques including responsive grids, custom navigation, hero sections, services, portfolio, and contact areas. 
This project is ideal for learning and demonstrating front-end design skills without the use of JavaScript.
